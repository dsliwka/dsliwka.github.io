It’s because each incentive design choice both signals information about your own beliefs and intentions as an employer and shapes the signaling value of employee behavior within the organization. If you don’t think through these signals carefully, you may end up approving a bonus scheme with results that are the opposite of what you intend. This article offers a way to help you align the signals your incentive scheme sends with your performance goals.\n\n When bonuses backfire: evidence from the workplace Jakob Alfitian, Dirk Sliwka, Timo Vogelsang Management Science\n\n\n\n PDF    WEB   Abstract\n\nMonetary incentives are widely used to align employee actions with employer objectives. We conducted a field experiment in a retail chain to evaluate whether an attendance bonus could reduce employee absenteeism. Apprentices in 232 stores were randomly assigned to a control group or one of two treatment groups in which a monetary or time-off attendance bonus was introduced for one year. We find that neither variant of the attendance bonus led to a systematic reduction in absenteeism. On the contrary, the monetary attendance bonus increased absenteeism substantially by around 50% on average, which corresponds to more than five additional days absent per employee and year. This effect was driven by the most recently hired apprentices. Survey results reveal that the monetary attendance bonus shifted the perception of absenteeism as acceptable behavior. The backfiring effect persisted beyond the end of the experiment, indicating a lasting erosion of social norms.\n\n Works councils as gatekeepers: Codetermination, management practices, and job satisfaction Christian Grund, Dirk Sliwka, Krystina Titz Labour Economics\n\n\n\n WEB   Abstract\n\nThis paper analyzes the role of works councils as gatekeepers safeguarding employee’s interests in the adoption of management practices to monitor employee performance and provide feedback. We first introduce a formal model predicting that (i) the introduction of such management practices leads to a stronger increase (or weaker decrease) in job satisfaction when a works council is in place, (ii) that this effect should be larger the lower the prior level of employee participation and (iii) that works councils increase the likelihood of the implementation of these practices at the level of individual employees. We provide evidence in line with these hypotheses, using linked-employer-employee panel data from Germany. We indeed find that the adoption of formal performance appraisals and feedback interviews is associated with a significantly larger increase in job satisfaction when there is a works council. This pattern is driven by establishments without collective bargaining agreements. The evidence also suggests that works councils indeed facilitate the implementation of such management practices, as codetermined firms have a higher likelihood that a practice implemented on the firm level is actually applied by middle management."

Our treatments provided for a gender-blind reallocation of the salary increase budget available to middle managers aimed at pay equity, along with different variants of corresponding decision guidance. All treatments substantially reduced the gender gap in salary increases, going well beyond a purely mechanical effect of the budget reallocation. Moreover, the treatments do not appear to have undermined warranted performance differentiation in salary increases.\n\n Information, incentives, and attention: A field experiment on the interaction of management controls Kathrin Manthei, Dirk Sliwka, Timo Vogelsang The Accounting Review\n\n\n\n PDF    WEB   Abstract\n\nWe study the profit effects and interplay of two core accounting practices in a field experiment in a large retail chain. In a 2 × 2 factorial design, we vary (1) whether store managers obtain decision-facilitating information on a profit metric and (2) whether they receive performance pay based on the same metric. We find that both practices increase profits significantly. In contrast to reasoning based on standard economic theory, we do not find complementarity between both interventions. Rather, we detect evidence in line with an attention-directing role of both practices: the introduction of each raises attention to the underlying objective, which induces a countervailing substitution effect.\n\n Talking about performance or paying for it? A field experiment on performance reviews and incentives Kathrin Manthei, Dirk Sliwka, Timo Vogelsang Management Science\n\n\n\n PDF    WEB   Abstract\n\nWe investigate the causal effect of performance pay and conversations about performance in 224 stores of a retail chain implementing a field experiment with a 2x2 factorial design. In the performance pay treatments, managers receive a bonus, which is a simple linear function of the profits achieved above a threshold value. In the performance review treatments, managers have to report their activities undertaken to increase profits in regular meetings. We find that whereas performance pay did not yield significant profit increases, performance review conversations increased profits by about 7%. However, when additionally receiving performance pay, the positive effect of performance reviews vanished. We provide evidence from surveys and meeting protocols that performance pay changes the nature of conversations, leading to a stronger self-reliance of store managers, which undermines the value of the performance reviews."

Our RCT varied whether freelancers were only paid a pure sales commission or a lower commission combined with a fixed payment per order to provide insurance against income fluctuations. We do not find evidence for effect heterogeneity with respect to risk aversion, but sizeable heterogeneity with respect to intrinsic motivation: While – in line with standard theory – the treatment reduced performance for less intrinsically motivated workers, it increased performance among workers with a high task motivation."

Introducing sales-based performance pay for district- and later for store-managers, we find negligible average treatment effects. Based on surveys and interviews, we develop a formal model demonstrating that the effect of performance pay decreases with experience and may even vanish in the limit. We provide empirical evidence in line with this hypothesis, for instance, finding positive treatment effects (only) in stores with low job experience.\n\n Descriptive norms and guilt aversion Anastasia Danilov, Kiryl Khalmetski, Dirk Sliwka Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization\n\n\n\n PDF    WEB   Abstract\n\nIt has been argued that guilt aversion (the desire to meet others’ expectations) and the social norm compliance (the desire to act similarly to other individuals in the same situation) are important drivers of human behavior. However, as we show in a theoretical model, these two motives are empirically indistinguishable when only one signal (either the expectation of a person affected by the choice or a signal about the descriptive norm) is revealed as each of these signals transmit information on the other benchmark. We address this problem by running an experiment in which signals for both benchmarks are revealed simultaneously. We find that both types of information affect dictator transfers in a one-shot game, yet the information about the behavior of others has a stronger effect than the disclosed recipient’s expectation. The effect of the recipient’s expectation is non-monotonic and becomes negative for very high expectations. We provide further evidence for the importance of guilt aversion in a second experiment where we display the recipient’s expectation and the expectation of a randomly picked recipient of another dictator.\n\n Employee identification and wages–on the economics of “Affective Commitment” Patrick Kampkötter, Lea M Petters, Dirk Sliwka Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization\n\n\n\n PDF    WEB   Abstract\n\nWe study the role of employees’ identification to the employer for wage growth. We first show in a formal model that identification implies countervailing effects: Employees with higher identification are more valuable as they exert higher efforts, but have weaker bargaining positions, and less outside options as they search less. Analyzing a novel representative panel dataset, we find that stronger identification is associated with less job search and turnover. Workers that have higher identification exhibit significantly lower wage growth. In line with the model, this pattern tends to be reversed conditional on having obtained an external offer."

We first show in a formal model, as well as using observational data from over 900 firms and in a series of lab experiments that choosing a manager who has a preference to spend resources for social causes can increase employee motivation. In turn, losses in shareholder value due to investments in social causes may be offset by gains in employees’ performance. The selection of a manager with social interests serves as a commitment device that raises employee motivation.\n\n Bonuses and performance evaluations Dirk Sliwka IZA World of Labor\n\n\n\n WEB    Bonus Plans, Subjective Performance Evaluations, and Career Concerns Dirk Sliwka Handbook of Labor, Human Resources and Population Economics\n\n\n\n WEB   Abstract\n\nThis article gives a selective review on the (behavioral) economics of incentives in organizations.

We show that equilibria naturally arise in which agents with low costs of lying randomize among a set of the highest potential reports. Such equilibria induce a distribution of reports in line with observed experimental patterns. We also find that higher image concerns lead to an increase in the range of reported lies, while the effect of the fixed cost of lying is the opposite.\n\n Multitasking and subjective performance evaluations: Theory and evidence from a field experiment in a bank Kathrin Manthei, Dirk Sliwka Management Science\n\n\n\n PDF    WEB   Abstract\n\nWe study the incentive effects of granting supervisors access to objective performance information when agents work on multiple tasks. We first analyze a formal model showing that incentives are lower powered when supervisors have no access to objective measures but assess performance subjectively by gathering information. This incentive loss is more pronounced when the span of control is larger and incentives are distorted toward more profitable tasks. We then investigate a field experiment conducted in a bank. In the treatment group, managers obtained access to objective performance measures, which raised efforts and profits. We find that the effects are driven by larger branches and lower margin products."

We argue that feedback affects beliefs in different dimensions – namely beliefs about the level of human capital and beliefs about the ability to learn – and this may explain some of the ambiguous effects. We experimentally study the causal effects of an exogenously administered change in beliefs in both of these dimensions on the motivation to learn. We find that confidence in the ability to learn raises incentives, while confidence in the level of human capital lowers incentives for individuals with high levels of human capital.\n\n More dispersion, higher bonuses? On differentiation in subjective performance evaluations Patrick Kampkötter, Dirk Sliwka Journal of Labor Economics\n\n\n\n PDF    WEB   Abstract\n\nWe investigate the claim that supervisors do not differentiate enough between high- and low-performing employees when evaluating performance. In a first step, this claim is illustrated in a formal model showing that rating compression reduces performance and subsequent bonus payments. The effect depends on the precision of performance information and may be reversed when cooperation is important. We then investigate panel data spanning different banks and find that stronger differentiation indeed increases subsequent bonus payments. The effect tends to be larger for larger spans of control and at higher hierarchical levels but is reversed at the lowest levels.\n\n The contribution of managers to organizational success: Evidence from German soccer Gerd Muehlheusser, Sandra Schneemann, Dirk Sliwka, Niklas Wallmeier Journal of Sports Economics\n\n\n\n PDF    WEB   Abstract\n\nWe study the impact of managers on the success of professional soccer teams using data from the German Bundesliga, where we are exploiting the high turnover rate of managers between teams to disentangle the managers’ contributions. Teams employing a manager from the top of the ability distribution gain on average considerably more points than those employing a manager from the bottom. Moreover, estimated abilities have significant predictive power for future performance. Managers also affect teams’ playing style. Finally, teams whose manager has been a former professional player perform worse on average compared to managers without a professional player career.\n\n Job rotation and employee performance–evidence from a longitudinal study in the financial services industry Patrick Kampkötter, Christine Harbring, Dirk Sliwka The International Journal of Human Resource Management\n\n\n\n WEB   Abstract\n\nJob rotation, i.e. a lateral transfer of an employee between jobs within a company, is frequently used as a means to develop employees, learn about their abilities as well as to motivate them. We investigate the determinants and performance effects of job rotation empirically by analyzing a large panel data-set covering the German banking and financial services sector. In particular, we study (i) how prior individual performance affects the propensity to rotate and (ii) how performance changes after the rotation. We find that while both, low- and high-performers rotate, lateral moves are more frequent among low performers. However, those having been rotated between jobs achieve a higher performance in subsequent years as compared to other non-rotating employees in a comparable position. Interestingly, this effect is driven by high performers, whereas for low performers, we find no significant relationship between job rotation and future performance. The results thus suggest that firms should focus their job rotation programs on high performers and should not expect that low performers achieve performance gains when being rotated to a different function."

In all treatments, agents earn the same wage sum, but wage increases are distributed differently over time. We find that agents work harder under increasing wage profiles if they do not know these profiles in advance. A profile that continuously increases wages by small amounts raises performance by about 15% relative to a constant wage. The effort reactions can be organized by a model in which agents reciprocally respond to wage impulses, comparing wages to an adaptive reference standard determined by the previous wage.\n\n Can contracts signal social norms? Experimental evidence Anastasia Danilov, Dirk Sliwka Management Science\n\n\n\n PDF    WEB   Abstract\n\nWe investigate whether incentive schemes signal social norms and thus affect behavior beyond their direct economic consequences. A one-shot principal–agent experiment is studied where prior to contract choice principals are informed about the past actions of other agents and thus have more information about norms of behavior. Compared with a setting in which principals are uninformed, agents exert substantially higher effort under a fixed wage contract when they are aware that an informed principal chose this contract. The informed principal’s choice apparently signals a norm not to exploit trust, which leads to more trustworthy behavior. This mechanism’s robustness is explored in further experiments.\n\n Social responsibility and incentives in the lab: Why do agents exert more effort when principals donate?

We study a simple principal-agent setting in the lab, where a principal decides whether to donate a fixed amount to a charity and, in the next step, an agent chooses his effort. We argue there are three potential mechanisms that can trigger a higher effort after a donation in this setting: distributional concerns, reciprocal altruism, and shared warm glow utility. We find agents choose higher efforts when principals donate. With respect to the mechanisms, we find evidence for reciprocal altruism and distributional concerns as drivers of agents’ performance reactions in the lab.\n\n People Analytics–Personaldaten als Erfolgsfaktor Torsten Biemann, Florian Englmaier, Dirk Sliwka, Ingo Weller Personal quarterly: Wissenschaftsjournal für die Personalpraxis"

Evidence from a field experiment Julian Conrads, Bernd Irlenbusch, Tommaso Reggiani, Rainer Michael Rilke, Dirk Sliwka Experimental Economics\n\n\n\n WEB   Abstract\n\nHow to hire voluntary helpers? We shed new light on this question by reporting a field experiment in which we invited 2859 students to help at the ‘ESA Europe 2012’ conference. Invitation emails varied non-monetary and monetary incentives to convince subjects to offer help. Students could apply to help at the conference and, if so, also specify the working time they wanted to provide. Just asking subjects to volunteer or offering them a certificate turned out to be significantly more motivating than mentioning that the regular conference fee would be waived for helpers. By means of an online-survey experiment, we find that intrinsic motivation to help is likely to have been crowded out by mentioning the waived fee. Increasing monetary incentives by varying hourly wages of 1, 5, and 10 Euros shows positive effects on the number of applications and on the working time offered. However, when comparing these results with treatments without any monetary compensation, the number of applications could not be increased by offering money and may even be reduced.\n\n The complementary use of experiments and field data to evaluate management practices: The case of subjective performance evaluations Patrick Kampkötter, Dirk Sliwka Journal of Institutional and Theoretical Economics\n\n\n\n Heterogeneity, inequity aversion, and group performance Felix Kölle, Dirk Sliwka, Nannan Zhou Social Choice and Welfare\n\n\n\n WEB   Abstract\n\nWe investigate the effects of inequality in wealth on the incentives to contribute to a group output when agents are inequity averse and may differ in ability.

As a result, less able agents may benefit from initially disadvantageous inequality. Moreover, the more inequity averse the agents, the more inequality should be imposed even by an egalitarian social planner.\n\n The impact of managerial change on performance: The role of team heterogeneity Gerd Muehlheusser, Sandra Schneemann, Dirk Sliwka Economic Inquiry\n\n\n\n WEB   Abstract\n\nWhen a key responsibility of a manager is to allocate more or less attractive tasks, subordinates have an incentive to work hard and demonstrate their talents.

We investigate this hypothesis using a large dataset on dismissals of soccer coaches, whose main task is indeed the selection of players. We find that dismissals enhance performance (only) in homogeneous teams. Moreover, we show that there is typically a negative selection bias when evaluating succession effects, which reconciles previous contradictory findings.\n\n Measuring the use of human resources practices and employee attitudes: The linked personnel panel Patrick Kampkötter, Jens Mohrenweiser, Dirk Sliwka, Susanne Steffes, Stefanie Wolter No Journal"

We first show in a formal model of job switching that (i) incumbents earn less than new recruits when human capital is mostly general but (ii) the opposite is the case if specific human capital is sufficiently important. In the empirical analysis we find that, on average, new hires earn more than comparable incumbents but – using a novel measure for the importance of specific human capital – these wage premia indeed strongly depend on human capital specificity."

We compare a baseline treatment in which supervisors are not restricted in their rating behavior to a forced distribution system in which they have to assign differentiated grades. We find that productivity is significantly higher under a forced distribution by about 6% to 12%. However, the productivity effects are less clear cut when participants have prior experience with the baseline condition. Moreover, a forced distribution becomes detrimental when workers have access to a simple option to sabotage each other.\n\n Social ties and subjective performance evaluations: an empirical investigation Kathrin Breuer, Petra Nieken, Dirk Sliwka Review of Managerial Science\n\n\n\n WEB   Abstract\n\nWe empirically investigate possible distortions in subjective performance evaluations. A key hypothesis is that evaluations are more upward biased the closer the social ties between supervisor and appraised employee. We test this hypothesis with a company data set from a call center organization which contains not only subjective assessments but also several more objective measures of performance. Controlling for these performance measures, we find strong evidence that evaluations are upwards biased in smaller teams and some evidence that supervisors give better ratings to employees they themselves have evaluated before.\n\n The dark side of team incentives: Experimental evidence on advice quality from financial service professionals Anastasia Danilov, Torsten Biemann, Thorn Kring, Dirk Sliwka Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization\n\n\n\n WEB   Abstract\n\nIn an experiment with professionals from the financial services sector, we investigate the impact of a team incentive scheme on the recommendation quality of investment products when advisors benefit from advising lower quality products. Experimental results reveal that, when group affiliation is strong, inferior products are recommended significantly more often under team incentives than under individual incentives.\n\n When higher prizes lead to lower efforts—The impact of favoritism in tournaments Claus Herbertz, Dirk Sliwka Economics Letters\n\n\n\n WEB   Abstract\n\nWe investigate the relationship between tournament prices and effort choices in the presence of favoritism.

We show that not imposing such an agreement can be beneficial for the principal, as the possibility to leave the firm generates implicit incentives for the agent. The principal prefers to impose such a clause if and only if the value created is sufficiently small relative to the agent’s outside option. If the principal can use an option contract for retaining the agent, she will never prefer a strict noncompete agreement.\n\n The anatomy of performance appraisals in Germany Christian Grund, Dirk Sliwka The International Journal of Human Resource Management\n\n\n\n WEB   Abstract\n\nWe investigate the use of performance appraisal (PA) in German firms. First, we derive hypotheses on individual and job-based determinants of PA usage. Based on a representative German data set on individual employees, we test these hypotheses and also explore the impact of PA on performance pay and further career prospects. The results include that PA is positively linked to an individual’s willingness to take risks. The performance of older employees and woman is evaluated less often. Furthermore, larger firms evaluate the performance of their employees more. We find evidence for a non-monotonic relation between the hierarchical level and usage of performance appraisal: The performance of employees with very high or very low responsibilities is assessed less often.\n\n Zwischen Mythos und Wahrheit Dirk Sliwka, Martin Emmerich, Patrick Kampkötter Personal"

Analyzing a two‐period model with two agents, we find that the effect of inequity aversion strongly depends on the information structure. When contributions are unobservable, agents act as though they were purely selfish. However, when contributions are made transparent at an interim stage, agents exert higher efforts in the first period and adjust their efforts according to the interim information in the second period. This form of peer pressure reduces free riding, and thus more efficient outcomes are attained. The results are confirmed in a real effort experiment.\n\n Variable Vergutung in der Unternehmenspraxis Martin Emmerich, Patrick Kampkotter, Dirk Sliwka Die Bank"

Besides selfish and fair or altruistic types, a third type of agent is introduced. These “conformists” have social preferences if they believe that sufficiently many of the others do as well. When there is asymmetric information about the distribution of preferences (the “social norm”), the incentive scheme offered or autonomy granted can reveal a principal’s beliefs about that norm. High-powered incentives may crowd out motivation as pessimism about the norm is conveyed. But by choosing fixed wages or granting autonomy, trust in a favorable norm may be signaled.\n\n Managerial Turnover and Strategic Change Dirk Sliwka Management Science\n\n\n\n WEB   Abstract\n\nThe connection between strategic change and managerial turnover is studied within a model where managers decide on a firm’s strategy. Managers as well as firm owners care for the long-term success of a company, but managers are also interested in their own reputation. Due to reputational concerns, managers are reluctant to alter strategic decisions they themselves made in the past even when internal accounting information indicates that they should do so. It is shown that it may well be optimal in some cases to dismiss managers of higher ability while someone less talented may be kept in office when strategic change has to be enforced.\n\n Reference-dependent preferences and the impact of wage increases on job satisfaction: Theory and evidence Christian Grund, Dirk Sliwka Journal of Institutional and Theoretical Economics"

Profits of firms are determined by agents’ unknown ability and the effort they choose. Before making second-period wage offers firms are informed about first-period profits. In a different treatment firms additionally learn the abilities of agents. Theory suggests high first-period equilibrium effort in the hidden ability treatment but no effort elsewhere. However, we find that effort tends to be higher in the revealed ability treatment and therefore conclude that transparency does not weaken, but strengthen career concerns incentives.\n\n Strategic delegation and mergers in oligopolistic contests Matthias Kräkel, Dirk Sliwka Journal of Economics and Business\n\n\n\n WEB   Abstract\n\nIn this paper, we combine the strategic delegation approach of Fershtman–Judd–Sklivas with contests. Here a contest means the expenditure of resources in order to influence the allocation of a fixed demand for a certain product. At the first stage of the game, firm owners decide on incentive schemes for their managers. At the second stage, managers choose the firms’ resource expenditures. These expenditures determine the firms’ market shares via a logit-form contest. If we have more than two firms, there will exist a unique subgame perfect equilibrium which is symmetric. We introduce the possibility of merging at an initial stage where owners are allowed to buy and shut down their rivals’ firms. The resulting merged subgame perfect equilibria show that there is clearly more merging under contest than under Cournot competition.\n\n On the notion of responsibility in organizations Dirk Sliwka Journal of Law, Economics, and Organization\n\n\n\n WEB   Abstract\n\nWe derive a natural definition of responsibility in a formal model in which employees care for their career prospects: A superior holds a subordinate responsible for a task when she announces her belief that this subordinate contributes most to this task. We show that those announced beliefs lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy, as the reputation of the responsible subordinate is then affected by the outcome of the task and he therefore has strong incentives to contribute to its success. There are equilibria in which either a single agent or no agent is responsible for a task but joint responsibility never arises. Several extensions are discussed."

It is shown that direct reciprocal behavior is much stronger in a more transparent situation where efforts are revealed to the principals. However, there is no significant impact of transparency on average effort as non-transparency leads to a stronger diversity in behavioral patterns such that, at the same time, the frequency of very low and very large effort levels increases.\n\n Envy and compassion in tournaments Christian Grund, Dirk Sliwka Journal of Economics & Management Strategy\n\n\n\n WEB   Abstract\n\nMany experiments and field studies indicate that most individuals are not purely motivated by material self-interest but also care about the well being of others. In this paper, we examine tournaments among inequity averse agents, who dislike disadvantageous inequity (envy) and advantageous inequity (compassion). It turns out that inequity averse agents exert higher efforts than purely self-interested agents for a given prize structure. Contrary to standard tournament theory, first-best efforts cannot be implemented when prizes are endogenous. Furthermore, the choice between vertical and lateral promotions is examined and it is shown that inequity costs have to be traded off against losses in human capital."

According to the previous literature, the more (less) able agent should choose a low (high) risk strategy, because the first one does not want to imperil his favorable position, whereas the last one can only gain by increasing risk. We show that this is not necessarily true. Risk taking affects equilibrium efforts as well as winning probabilities. Depending on both effects diverse equilibria are possible. For example, the low and the high ability agent may both choose high risks or both choose low risks."

When and why dismissing a manager increases the subordinates’ performance Felix Höffler, Dirk Sliwka European Economic Review\n\n\n\n WEB   Abstract\n\nIf a manager stays in office for a long time he will have learned much about his subordinates. Thus competition among them will be weak as the manager has made up his mind who is suited best for which position. With a new manager the “race” for favorable tasks is restarted leading subordinates to exert higher effort. But for the firm-owner the trade-off arises that with a new manager effort is larger but the quality of task allocation is worse since information is lost. The optimal dismissal policy will be nonmonotonic in the expected heterogeneity of the subordinates’ abilities.\n\n Organizational structure and innovative activity Dirk Sliwka Economics of Governance\n\n\n\n WEB   Abstract\n\nA model is analyzed in which agents exert effort to create innovations within an organization. When payments are infeasible, the decision on the implementation of a proposal is shown to be made by simple monotonic decision rules. Organizational structure is then determined by a collection of decision rules. A trade-off arises between the use of information and the incentives created by a rule. If the former dominates it will currently be optimal to install a hierarchy. Otherwise decentralization by granting autonomy to innovators may be better. Requiring unanimous decision-making is optimal if a strong filtering of proposals is necessary.\n\n Zu impliziten Anreizen in Arbeitsbeziehungen—eine experimentelle Studie Bernd Irlenbusch, Dirk Sliwka Ökonomische Analyse von Governance-Strukturen"

We give an explanation for both claims in a formal model. The distortion toward operational effort arises because with financial performance measures strategic effort can only be rewarded in the future. But renegotiation-proof long-term compensation plans entail too weak variable components in the future. This problem can be reduced by introducing performance measures that help to disentangle strategic and operational effects."

Hence, integration can be optimal even though only the supplier makes an investment decision. This may also clarify the discussion on which activities belong to a firm’s core competencies. Furthermore, we show that if specificity is contractible, less than the efficient degree of specificity will deliberately be chosen since investment incentives are thereby improved.\n\n On the costs and benefits of delegation in organizations Dirk Sliwka Journal of Institutional and Theoretical Economics\n\n\n\n Innerbetriebliche Aufgabenverteilung und Delegation Matthias Kräkel, Dirk Sliwka Die Prinzipal-Agenten-Theorie in der Betriebswirtschaftslehre"
