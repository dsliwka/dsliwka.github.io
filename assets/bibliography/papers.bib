  abstract={We study the value of skill management in organizations. In a natural field experiment with 2,582 service technicians, we vary managers’ ability to monitor and manage employee skills. We find that removing managers’ access to hard information on employee skills reduced training intensity, work performance, and job satisfaction. Combining detailed personnel records and survey data, we show that the intervention lowered employee efforts to identify training needs and managerial attention to employee development. In particular, high-skill employees received less training to broaden their skill set and, in turn, performance losses are driven by higher completion times for complex work assignments.}

In a field experiment with 829 service technicians in 15 firms, we randomly allocated half of the technicians in each firm to a treatment group receiving bonuses for regularly performing sales activities for 12 weeks. We find a significant increase in sales activities not only during but also after the incentive phase. Using data from a post-experimental survey, we compare different behavioral channels. We find no evidence for increased automaticity, human capital acquisition, or signals about task priorities, but strong evidence for the role of acquired taste: Technicians in the treatment group report higher levels of intrinsic motivation to perform sales activities even after the incentive has been discontinued.}

  abstract={Why do bonuses sometimes backfire? It’s because each incentive design choice both signals information about your own beliefs and intentions as an employer and shapes the signaling value of employee behavior within the organization. If you don’t think through these signals carefully, you may end up approving a bonus scheme with results that are the opposite of what you intend. This article offers a way to help you align the signals your incentive scheme sends with your performance goals.}

  abstract={We present a natural field experiment on promoting pay equity through simple modifications to the salary review process in a large technology firm, involving 623 middle managers and 8,951 employees. Our treatments provided for a gender-blind reallocation of the salary increase budget available to middle managers aimed at pay equity, along with different variants of corresponding decision guidance. All treatments substantially reduced the gender gap in salary increases, going well beyond a purely mechanical effect of the budget reallocation. Moreover, the treatments do not appear to have undermined warranted performance differentiation in salary increases.},

  abstract={Monetary incentives are widely used to align employee actions with employer objectives. We conducted a field experiment in a retail chain to evaluate whether an attendance bonus could reduce employee absenteeism. Apprentices in 232 stores were randomly assigned to a control group or one of two treatment groups in which a monetary or time-off attendance bonus was introduced for one year. We find that neither variant of the attendance bonus led to a systematic reduction in absenteeism. On the contrary, the monetary attendance bonus increased absenteeism substantially by around 50% on average, which corresponds to more than five additional days absent per employee and year. This effect was driven by the most recently hired apprentices. Survey results reveal that the monetary attendance bonus shifted the perception of absenteeism as acceptable behavior. The backfiring effect persisted beyond the end of the experiment, indicating a lasting erosion of social norms.},

abstract = {This paper analyzes the role of works councils as gatekeepers safeguarding employee's interests in the adoption of management practices to monitor employee performance and provide feedback. We first introduce a formal model predicting that (i) the introduction of such management practices leads to a stronger increase (or weaker decrease) in job satisfaction when a works council is in place, (ii) that this effect should be larger the lower the prior level of employee participation and (iii) that works councils increase the likelihood of the implementation of these practices at the level of individual employees. We provide evidence in line with these hypotheses, using linked-employer-employee panel data from Germany. We indeed find that the adoption of formal performance appraisals and feedback interviews is associated with a significantly larger increase in job satisfaction when there is a works council. This pattern is driven by establishments without collective bargaining agreements. The evidence also suggests that works councils indeed facilitate the implementation of such management practices, as codetermined firms have a higher likelihood that a practice implemented on the firm level is actually applied by middle management.},

In the experiment, subjects in the role of workers perform a real effort task. Subjects in the role of supervisors observe samples of the workers’ output and assess their performance. We conduct 6 experimental treatments varying (i) whether workers’ pay depends on the performance evaluation, (ii) whether supervisors are paid for the accuracy of their evaluations, and (iii) the precision of the information available to supervisors. Moreover, we use the exogenous assignment of supervisors to workers to investigate the association between supervisors' social preferences and their rating quality. In line with the model of optimal evaluations, we find that ratings are more lenient and less informative when they determine bonus payments. Rewards for accuracy reduce leniency and can enhance informativeness. When supervisors have access to more detailed performance information, their ratings vary more with the performance signal and become more informative. Contrary to expectations, we do not find that more prosocial supervisors are systematically more lenient when their ratings affect worker's payoffs. Instead, they are more diligent in their rating behavior, resulting in more accurate and informative performance evaluations.},

Rather, we detect evidence in line with an attention-directing role of both practices: the introduction of each raises attention to the underlying objective, which induces a countervailing substitution effect.},

However, when additionally receiving performance pay, the positive effect of performance reviews vanished.

However, as we show in a theoretical model, these two motives are empirically indistinguishable when only one signal (either the expectation of a person affected by the choice or a signal about the descriptive norm) is revealed as each of these signals transmit information on the other benchmark. We address this problem by running an experiment in which signals for both benchmarks are revealed simultaneously. We find that both types of information affect dictator transfers in a one-shot game, yet the information about the behavior of others has a stronger effect than the disclosed recipient’s expectation. The effect of the recipient’s expectation is non-monotonic and becomes negative for very high expectations. We provide further evidence for the importance of guilt aversion in a second experiment where we display the recipient's expectation and the expectation of a randomly picked recipient of another dictator.},

In particular, we study (i) how prior individual performance affects the propensity to rotate and (ii) how performance changes after the rotation. We find that while both, low- and high-performers rotate, lateral moves are more frequent among low performers. However, those having been rotated between jobs achieve a higher performance in subsequent years as compared to other non-rotating employees in a comparable position. Interestingly, this effect is driven by high performers, whereas for low performers, we find no significant relationship between job rotation and future performance. The results thus suggest that firms should focus their job rotation programs on high performers and should not expect that low performers achieve performance gains when being rotated to a different function.},

Invitation emails varied non-monetary and monetary incentives to convince subjects to offer help.

Just asking subjects to volunteer or offering them a certificate turned out to be significantly more motivating than mentioning that the regular conference fee would be waived for helpers. By means of an online-survey experiment, we find that intrinsic motivation to help is likely to have been crowded out by mentioning the waived fee. Increasing monetary incentives by varying hourly wages of 1, 5, and 10 Euros shows positive effects on the number of applications and on the working time offered. However, when comparing these results with treatments without any monetary compensation, the number of applications could not be increased by offering money and may even be reduced.},

We show that equality may lead to a reduction of contributions below levels generated by purely selfish agents. But introducing inequality motivates more productive agents to exert higher efforts and help the group to coordinate on equilibria with less free-riding. As a result, less able agents may benefit from initially disadvantageous inequality. Moreover, the more inequity averse the agents, the more inequality should be imposed even by an egalitarian social planner.},

We find that dismissals enhance performance (only) in homogeneous teams. Moreover, we show that there is typically a negative selection bias when evaluating succession effects, which reconciles previous contradictory findings.},

These expenditures determine the firms’ market shares via a logit-form contest. If we have more than two firms, there will exist a unique subgame perfect equilibrium which is symmetric.

The resulting merged subgame perfect equilibria show that there is clearly more merging under contest than under Cournot competition.},

Contrary to standard tournament theory, first-best efforts cannot be implemented when prizes are endogenous. Furthermore, the choice between vertical and lateral promotions is examined and it is shown that inequity costs have to be traded off against losses in human capital.},

When payments are infeasible, the decision on the implementation of a proposal is shown to be made by simple monotonic decision rules. Organizational structure is then determined by a collection of decision rules. A trade-off arises between the use of information and the incentives created by a rule. If the former dominates it will currently be optimal to install a hierarchy. Otherwise decentralization by granting autonomy to innovators may be better. Requiring unanimous decision-making is optimal if a strong filtering of proposals is necessary.},

  abstract={It is often claimed that (i) managers work too hard on operational issues and do not spend enough effort on strategic activities, and (ii) something can be done about this by introducing nonfinancial performance measures, as for instance with a balanced scorecard. We give an explanation for both claims in a formal model. The distortion toward operational effort arises because with financial performance measures strategic effort can only be rewarded in the future. But renegotiation-proof long-term compensation plans entail too weak variable components in the future. This problem can be reduced by introducing performance measures that help to disentangle strategic and operational effects.},

  abstract={The optimal incentives for a team are analyzed in a principal-agent model. It is shown that it can be beneficial to make an agent’s compensation positively dependent on another agent’s success even when tasks are technologically independent. The introduction of team compensation induces implicit cooperation and mutual monitoring. This is modeled explicitly in a repeated game. Team compensation can be optimal even in cases, where in the static model relative performance evaluation is preferred. It is the more beneficial the higher the probability of an ongoing relationship.},

  abstract={We analyze in an incomplete contracts model whether a supplier should be integrated if in addition to his investment level he chooses the degree of relationship specificity. A basic trade-off arises: While non-integration leads to higher investment incentives, potential synergies are foregone. Hence, integration can be optimal even though only the supplier makes an investment decision. This may also clarify the discussion on which activities belong to a firm’s core competencies. Furthermore, we show that if specificity is contractible, less than the efficient degree of specificity will deliberately be chosen since investment incentives are thereby improved.},
